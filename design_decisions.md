####landing page
- adjust line height of body text for better readablilty based on [pearsonified] (http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/); now 16pt. font with 25pt spacing
- tablet view
  - move file list and keywords to the bottom of the page, with metrics and license b/c the previous split felt arbitrary.
  - move download buttons to just below bibliographic info
- mobile view
  - collapse the 4 boxes into a single column at the bottom of the page
  - move download buttons between version history and boxes; downloading is likely to be much less important than reading on phones
  - put update button at top-left to make it prominent, but out-of-the-way for right-handed scrolling.

####multi-page
  - make ORCIDs link-blue to indicate that they can be clicked on to open the author's profile; displaying full address seems unnecessary and cluttered.

####homepage
  - add publishing campus to recent datasets
